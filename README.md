# Competitive Programming
I'm using this repository for practicing DSA, LeetCode and Codeforces.<br><br>
Basically this is me trying to set foot into the whole competitive programming scene :)
<br>
## Rules for this repository<br>
- <b>NO CHATGPT AND AI!!!</b> Only pure thought process and problem solving. I am allowed to only use docs for debugging or looking up how to do something I dont know/remember.
- Only make a commit when I have a final solution that is accepted on the problem.
- When I want to retry a problem, I need to delete and commit the deletion.
